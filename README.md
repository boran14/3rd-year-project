# 3rd-year-project
You can either follow the instructions below or follow the video that i made to help you from this link
## 1-Download
First of all, download the source code as a .zip file and save it to your desktop.
## 2-Move folders
After you downloaded and extracted the folder, go inside the folder, go to the "3rd-year-project-main" folder and now you should see a folder called "Hellofx". Copy/cut this folder and paste it into your desktop.
## 3-Adding JavaFX library
Download the javafx sdk that i used from my google drive from the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qRuMst8GB67qEF0W_SBl-MxZjPi_R5hG?usp=sharing and place it to disk C: so that the path of the folder is "C:\javafx-sdk-11.0.2"
Note that if you place it somewhere else,  you need to edit launch.jason file and change vmargs to that path of the folder
## 4-Run
After these steps, you should be able to run the code in Visual Studio Code.
